# Analyzing-Automobile-Acceleration-with-Regression-Modeling
Used the mtcars dataset to build a regression model predicting quarter-mile time (qsec) based on key automotive variables. Explored first- and second-order effects, transformations, multicollinearity, leverage, and influential points to identify the most impactful predictors of vehicle acceleration.
